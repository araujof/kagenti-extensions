"""Env-gated activation hook for the propagate-only OTel shim.

Dockerfile.otel-shim installs this as ``_lineage_propagate.py`` in the app
environment's site-packages next to a one-line ``.pth``, so ``site`` imports
it at every interpreter start, before any app code. The shim thus attaches
through the environment (like ``JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS`` / ``NODE_OPTIONS``); the
container's command is never rewritten.

Inert unless ``LINEAGE_PROPAGATE=1``. When active: pin the propagate-only
posture as env *defaults* (every exporter ``none``, ``tracecontext,baggage``
propagators — ``setdefault``, so a deliberate override still wins), then run
stock auto-instrumentation via ``initialize()``; which instrumentors activate
depends on which libraries the image carries.

MCP context bridge (mcp 1.x only): the MCP Python SDK's streamable-HTTP
client hands every outbound message over a memory stream to a background task
started when the session was opened, and that task performs the HTTP POST.
Contextvars are copied into a task at creation, so the OTel context there is
the one from session open — none, for a session an app holds across requests —
and the httpx instrumentor would start a fresh trace per tool call. mcp 2.x
carries the sender's context through its streams itself (``_context_streams``);
the 1.x line does not. For a 1.x the hook stamps the caller's OTel context on
each ``SessionMessage`` as it is built (caller's task) and re-attaches it around
the POST (``_handle_post_request``, transport's task); an empty stamp is not
attached. Only the OTel context crosses; nothing else of the caller's task. On
a 2.x the hook does nothing. The stamp is installed wherever ``mcp`` imports,
tool servers included, and is inert there. If the SDK lacks either seam the bridge is
not installed, propagation stays on, and a tool call on a held session roots a
trace of its own (``parent.source=none`` on the tool pod's inbound hop) —
the pre-bridge shape, one warning at startup. A resumed request (the SDK's
``_handle_resumption_request``) is not bridged. Importing the SDK's client
module costs every gated interpreter its import time, once.

Failure policy: never take the app down. ``initialize()`` swallows its own
exceptions, the guard below covers the rest, and ``site`` itself survives a
broken ``.pth`` line. A hook failure therefore means propagation is OFF and the
trace fragments at this pod, visibly (``parent.source=none`` on its outbound
hops) — absent lineage,
never wrong lineage.

    """Carry the caller's OTel context across the MCP client transport's task
    boundary, for the mcp 1.x line. Returns True when the bridge is in place
    (or was already); False when ``mcp`` is absent or is a 2.x that propagates
    the context itself (silently), or when a 1.x lacks the seams (one
    warning). An installed ``mcp`` that fails to import raises, so the caller
    logs it instead of the bridge staying off in silence. A stamp that carries nothing is never attached, so a message
